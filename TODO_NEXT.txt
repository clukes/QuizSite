- LEFTOFF: Done quiz start and game start screens.
- TODO: Round End/Quiz End screens.

ISSUES:
- Sort out channels not working over https / (Test)
- Doesn't put your answer in as current answer when new answer is shown. / (Test)
- Marking next question doesn't remove answers for previous question. / (Test)
- When show question is pressed and answers on the screen, the answers don't go away. / (Test)
- Why is points rounding to 1dp. Should be 2dp. / (Test)



- On Round End/Quiz End screens, display scores of users one by one.

- On player list, show who's answered. Have a counter, 3/6 peoples answered.

- Have a round start and round end screen:
  Round Start: Show round info with background image.
  Round End: Show player scores.


- Setup channels so that when the leader pushes a button to show question,
it shows players that question:
- Show player a game starting screen when leader presses start game.
- Add leave game button for player on game screen.

- Get show all answers button working on leader screen

- Add next and previous buttons on question. Go to question with next number.
- Add a game (different name maybe? quiz?) to collate the rounds into one group.

- When displaying marking on player screen, if correct then checkmark,
if incorrect then cross, otherwise display some partial mark and the number of points.

- Leader can press button to display players answers, can display in the order they want.
Answers will be displayed to players in that order.
- Leader selects whether answer is correct or not, optionally enters a manual score, e.g. 0.5 points.
- Scores are added to player totals.
- Show scores to players at end of each round.
- Show scores to leader all the time.

- Back to question list button on leader question detail.

- On leader question screen, list users first. As their answers come in, put the answer next to the user.
So the leader can easily see who hasn't answered.
- Keep player on current question on reload. Store current question in database.

- Auto update everyones screen when someone leaves/joins the game.

- Put in template of both leader and player: current room code, player list, scores

- Do something about coming back and reusing username

- Message when game ends should be popup, with button to return home.

- Have bonus points

- Add background image for rounds

- Add date to game. Maybe start and end.

- In game, store scores for each player.

- If leader has no username, redirect to username screen

- Test on mobile/tablet with different screen sizes

- Tab the answers on both player and leader screens. Put in table so equally spaced.

- When leader ends game, have all players go back to home.

- When player on game page, check that they are actually in that game.

- Add change username button
- Check if username is already in use, if so give message saying that
