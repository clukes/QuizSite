- LEFTOFF: Done Quiz End screen animation.
- TODO: Upload to heroku.

ROUND PRIORITY LIST:
- Audio (NEED FIND AUDIO HOST. MIXDROP GIVES ADS)
- Progressive Scoring Round (E.g. 1 second of song, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, save at what point someone answers)
- Outsourced Round (Use Iframe to include another website. In database for the question, store url,
  and search string. Have submit button, when they click it it will search in the iframe for the string,
  in order to get their answer. MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE, CROSS-SITE JAVASCRIPT IS NOT POSSIBLE.
  SO CANNOT EASILY SEARCH IN IFRAME)
- Questions all on one page, pages have connection.

- TEST ON MOBILE, ENSURE ALL LOOKS GOOD.
- FIX PLAYER LIST, DUPLICATE PLAYERS SHOW UP

- Have edit answer button that puts current answer in text box.
- Change username button.
- Maybe change text box to text area. Grow with answer if possible.
- Have hints, have possibility to send message to one player from leader screen.

URGENT ISSUES:
- If put 1 in partial it throws an error /
- WTF IS HAPPENING WITH TIMER (The problem is with system clocks being different, maybe pull exact time somehow. Maybe send current time on server and calculate offset.)
- Maybe use offset in timer, in systemdate. take away the offset from the timerlength so that it shows correct length? Idk

NON URGENT ISSUES:
- maybe for video rounds, i could try make sure low quality plays, and also maybe i put a button that says "video not playing?", which then shows an image that has like a few screenshots from video.

- Quiz End is a bit fast on the runners up screen.
- Fireworks gif background on quiz end.
- On mobile, make sure player list isn't making question space smaller.
- On mobile, quiz end screen hits top of screen and looks weird.
- Question too close to home button on mobile.
- Current answer shows when switching to another question.
- On game starting screen it shows game loading before the screen
- Change colour of bonus, it clashes with indicating who you are.


- On Round End/Quiz End screens, display scores of users one by one. Put top 3 on podium with medals.

- On player list, show who's answered. Have a counter, 3/6 peoples answered.

- Message when game ends should be popup, with button to return home.

- Tell leader what screen is currently shown.

- Tab the answers on both player and leader screens. Put in table so equally spaced.

- Maybe put timeout so if people still in game, on home screen if game ended then say that.

- Marking transition screen

- Put people who are tied in the results with same ranking.

- Make Quiz end more exciting. Have some animation, sparkles maybe. Podium, show results one by one.

- Add next and previous buttons on question. Go to question with next number.

- Back to question list button on leader question detail.

- Do something about coming back and reusing username.

- Add date to game. Maybe start and end.

- In game, store scores for each player.

- If leader has no username, redirect to username screen

- Multiple choice maybe have leader show the options to players.

- When player on game page, check that they are actually in that game.

- Add change username button

- Have a website logo/image, put in the tab bar.
- Make animated logo, maybe use svgator.
