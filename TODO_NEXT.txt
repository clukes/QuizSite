- LEFTOFF:
- TODO:

- PUT QUIZ SITE V2.0 WHEN PLAY NEXT TIME

ROUND PRIORITY LIST:
- Multiple Choice.
- Video/Audio.

- TEST ON MOBILE, ENSURE ALL LOOKS GOOD.
- FIX PLAYER LIST, DUPLICATE PLAYERS SHOW UP

NON URGENT ISSUES:
- When leaving and rejoining, adds weird spacing.
- Current answer shows when switching to another question.
- Red outline on textbox on firefox.
- On mobile, make sure player list isn't making question space smaller. Put space between bottom and player list and mobile.
- On mobile, quiz end screen hits top of screen and looks weird.
- Fraction is not aligned when zoomed in. Change the slash into one big slash.
- Question too close to home button on mobile.


- On Round End/Quiz End screens, display scores of users one by one.

- On player list, show who's answered. Have a counter, 3/6 peoples answered.

- Message when game ends should be popup, with button to return home.

- Tell leader what screen is currently shown.

- Tab the answers on both player and leader screens. Put in table so equally spaced.

- Maybe put timeout so if people still in game, on home screen if game ended then say that.

- Marking transition screen

- Put people who are tied in the results with same ranking.

- Make Quiz end more exciting. Have some animation, sparkles maybe. Podium, show results one by one.

- Add next and previous buttons on question. Go to question with next number.

- Back to question list button on leader question detail.

- Do something about coming back and reusing username.

- Have bonus points.

- Maybe overlay text on image on round start screen.

- Add background image for rounds.

- Add date to game. Maybe start and end.

- In game, store scores for each player.

- If leader has no username, redirect to username screen

- When player on game page, check that they are actually in that game.

- Add change username button
