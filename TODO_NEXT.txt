NON URGENT ISSUES:

- Red outline on textbox on firefox. /
- Put space between bottom and player list and mobile. /
- Fraction is not aligned when zoomed in. Change the slash into one big slash. /
- On mobile, make sure player list isn't making question space smaller.
- On mobile, quiz end screen hits top of screen and looks weird.
- Question too close to home button on mobile.
- Current answer shows when switching to another question.
- On game starting screen it shows game loading before the screen
- Change colour of bonus, it clashes with indicating who you are.

- On Round End/Quiz End screens, display scores of users one by one. Put top 3 on podium with medals.

- On player list, show who's answered. Have a counter, 3/6 peoples answered.

- Message when game ends should be popup, with button to return home.

- Tab the answers on both player and leader screens. Put in table so equally spaced.

- Maybe put timeout so if people still in game, on home screen if game ended then say that.

- Do something about coming back and reusing username.

- Maybe overlay text on image on round start screen.
