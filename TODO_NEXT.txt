- LEFTOFF: Started getting map working
- TODO: - More robust testing on ordering round. Improve the aesthetics.
- Screen on leaders with selection boxes to match username to name, e.g. lesandlu to nan lesley.
- Then dynamically fill the table of results, and also select which video to play.

- Get client to send message when video loaded. Then I synchronise clicking play.

- Change map field in mapround to choicefield
- Ordering round can you set margin as percentage?
- Map round maybe have some questions show labels and some not.
- Map round only supports having a specific point, not like a radius. So answer can't be UK, has to be more specific.
  - Use a radius. Then when calculating distance, you can calculate to the center of circle then subtract the radius. Can also subtract the radius from the max distance to change formula.
- Make sure google trends question works on ipad. have one in next quiz.
- Automark multiple choice.
- Put buttons in a table on leader marking screen, so that they're in the same place regardless of username. /

- On question 2 in who is this round, first picture is too big vertically. /
- On google trends round, get rid of fractions. /
- On google trends round, corona doesn't work.? Maybe that's fixed?
- On google trends round, if there's a null it doesn't work. /
- On google trends round, mcdonald's doesn't work on leader screen. /
- Google trends round, first place gets 1 point, 2nd gets 0.75, 3rd gets 0.5, 4th gets 0.25. But if 0 searches then get 0.
- Google trends round, doesn't show graph on ipad. - Problem is the cross-site tracking that's disabled on ipad. It causes it not to load because of the samesite xsrf token.

Have a tiebreaker question.

PRIORITY:
1. Can't see round images on mobile.
2. maybe for video rounds, i could try make sure low quality plays, and also maybe i put a button that says "video not playing?", which then shows an image that has like a few screenshots from video.
3. Add import/export.


ROUND PRIORITY LIST:
- Round where you order things. - Automark.
- Map round have to click on map. - Automark, check distance from actual answer and score based on who gets closest. Show where everyone placed their pins on the show correct answer. When entering an answer, show a current answer pin in a different colour.
- Questions all on one page, questions have connection. (Maybe incorporate in crossword)
- Crossword. - Make sure to automark. (How to store in datbase? crossword to json https://github.com/keiranking/Phil?) All answers have a connection which they have to give.
- Matchup round. - Automark too.
- Drawing round.

- Outsourced Round (Use Iframe to include another website. In database for the question, store url,
  and search string. Have submit button, when they click it it will search in the iframe for the string,
  in order to get their answer. MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE, CROSS-SITE JAVASCRIPT IS NOT POSSIBLE.
  SO CANNOT EASILY SEARCH IN IFRAME)

- TEST ON MOBILE, ENSURE ALL LOOKS GOOD.
- FIX PLAYER LIST, DUPLICATE PLAYERS SHOW UP

- Automatic marking for multiple choice

- Have hints, have possibility to send message to one player from leader screen.

- Add in import/export.

URGENT ISSUES:

NON URGENT ISSUES:
- Can't see round images on mobile.
- When players tie, they are given the same ranking.
- maybe for video rounds, i could try make sure low quality plays, and also maybe i put a button that says "video not playing?", which then shows an image that has like a few screenshots from video.
- Quiz End is a bit fast on the runners up screen.
- Fireworks gif background on quiz end.
- On mobile, make sure player list isn't making question space smaller.
- On mobile, quiz end screen hits top of screen and looks weird.
- Question too close to home button on mobile.
- Current answer shows when switching to another question.
- On game starting screen it shows game loading before the screen
- Change colour of bonus, it clashes with indicating who you are.


- Make logo.

- Text overlay on round start screen overlaps home button on mobile.

- On player list, show who's answered. Have a counter, 3/6 peoples answered.

- Message when game ends should be popup, with button to return home.

- Tell leader what screen is currently shown.

- Tab the answers on both player and leader screens. Put in table so equally spaced.

- Maybe put timeout so if people still in game, on home screen if game ended then say that.

- Marking transition screen

- Put people who are tied in the results with same ranking.

- Make Quiz end more exciting. Have some animation, sparkles maybe. Podium, show results one by one.

- Add next and previous buttons on question. Go to question with next number.

- Back to question list button on leader question detail.

- Do something about coming back and reusing username.

- Add date to game. Maybe start and end.

- In game, store scores for each player.

- If leader has no username, redirect to username screen

- Multiple choice maybe have leader show the options to players.

- When player on game page, check that they are actually in that game.

- Add change username button

- Have a website logo/image, put in the tab bar.
- Make animated logo, maybe use svgator.

- Unique username doesn't ignore case. So can have players with both con and Con.
